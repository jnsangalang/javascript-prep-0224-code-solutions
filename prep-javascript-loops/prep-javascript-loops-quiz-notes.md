## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?

The condition is the expression that the loop tests each time when it repeats, while the condition is true the loop keeps running through

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?

the first expression is evaluated once at the beginning of the loop. If it is true, then the loop continues through.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?

The second expression defines the condition for the loop to run, it is evaluated if the first expression is returned as true

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?

The third expression is executed every time after the code (2nd expression) is executed

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?

The last expression checks each time after the 2nd expression is run, if the value is still true it allows the loop to keep going. When the value is false, it stops the loop

- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
